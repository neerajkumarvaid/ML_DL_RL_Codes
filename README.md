# ML_DL_RL_Codes
Machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, statistics and optimization codes in Python. I have organized the codes in respective sub-folders as shown below.

I used Python 3.7 to code these algorithms.  

 **Folder** | **Description** |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Data Science from Scratch](https://github.com/neerajkumarvaid/Data-Science-From-Scratch-Python) | Python implementations of the algorithms discussed in the book [Data Science from Scratch](https://www.amazon.ca/Data-Science-Scratch-Principles-Python/dp/149190142X) by Joel Grus.  |
| [Machine Learning](https://github.com/neerajkumarvaid/ML_DL_RL_Codes/tree/master/Machine_Learning) | Implementations of various machine learning algorithms expalined in books from Drs. Kevin Murphy and Christopher Bishop.|
