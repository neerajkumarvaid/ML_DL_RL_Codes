# ML_DL_RL_Codes
Machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, statistics and optimization codes in Python. I have organized the codes in respective sub-folders as shown below.

I used Python 3.7 to code these algorithms.  

 **Folder** | **Description** |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Machine Learning](https://github.com/neerajkumarvaid/ML_DL_RL_Codes/tree/master/Machine_Learning) | Implementations of various machine learning algorithms expalined in the book [Patter Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher Bishop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/prml-book/).  |
